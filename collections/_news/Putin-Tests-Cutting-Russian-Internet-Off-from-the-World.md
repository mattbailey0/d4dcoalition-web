Vladimir Putin’s regime is [set to start testing][link] the feasibility of cutting off the nation's internet servers from the global internet. While Putin’s United Russia party insists that the motivation for this is to increase Russian internet self-sufficiency, regime critics and internet rights activists argue that it is a move designed to eliminate Russian citizens’ access to international news and commentary that is critical of the regime. This action would not only be bold and technically complicated, but also a major setback to internet freedom in Russia.
