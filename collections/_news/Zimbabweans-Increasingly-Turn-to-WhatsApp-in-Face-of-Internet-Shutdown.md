When the government of Zimbabwe launched a large hike in fuel prices easier this year, large protests prompted the state to shutter all internet resources in a nation-wide web media blackout. In response, more Zimbabweans than ever [began to turn to the communications application WhatsApp][link] to get their news, including reports of coordinated government use of violence against protestors. These “e-[news]papers” are sent by WhatsApp text message, complete with photos and often even soundbites, to the phones of thousands of Zimbabwean subscribers. Though e-papers delivered via WhatsApp have existed since at least the ousting of former national president Robert Mugabe in late-2017, they are becoming ever more common in a country where the traditional media space has slowly closed over the years.
