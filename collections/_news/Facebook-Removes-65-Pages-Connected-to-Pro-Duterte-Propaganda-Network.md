Ahead of the upcoming May elections in the Philippines, [Facebook has removed 65 pages][link] that it deemed propaganda primarily in favor of incumbent Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte or his administration and allies. These pages, which claimed or implied that they were run by regular Philippine citizens supporting the Duterte administration, were shown to be linked to the social media strategist for the president, Nic Gabunada. This is just the most recent action in Facebookâ€™s new operational strategy to remove content which it deems to be inauthentic.
