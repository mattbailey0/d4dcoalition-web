The use of social media and video-streaming platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Vimeo, etc. have become ways for individuals to spread images and footage of mass violence like that of the Christchurch, New Zealand mosque shootings in March. In response, the president of Microsoft [has suggested][link] creating a “joint virtual command center” to quickly respond to postings of such heinous acts. In a blog post, the industry leader has suggested that certain emergency situations like the New Zealand massacre be deemed “major events” that would warrant all companies providing social media or video-streaming services to work together on a temporary flag-and-remove campaign for offensive content regarding the event. Facebook [followed this with an announcement][link2] that it would be removing all content relating to white supremacy or separatism posted by users of its platform starting in April.
