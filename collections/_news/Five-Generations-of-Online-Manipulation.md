In a piece for the Foreign Policy Research Institute about his upcoming book, scholar Clint Watts [identifies][link] five “generations” of intentional online manipulation by state, criminal, and political actors, while making some dire predictions of internet’s future. The first generation, “Disrupting the System,” revolved around hackers committed denial-of access attacks shutting down people's access to the internet. The second, “Exploiting the System,” was all about extremist groups (ISIS, Al Qaeda, etc.) using the internet to gain followers, mainly through sites like Twitter, and Youtube. The third, “Distorting the System” was widely seen from Russian government sources deliberately spreading false and misleading information in western internet sources. The fourth, “Dominating the System” foresees a near-future when private companies, interest groups and political parties adopt Russian tactics to invent news on a mass scale to drive public narratives. The fifth, “Owning the System” will be in the medium-to-long-term future, when authoritarian regimes begin to disconnect their national networks from the world wide web, leaving their subjects to consume only government-approved online media.
