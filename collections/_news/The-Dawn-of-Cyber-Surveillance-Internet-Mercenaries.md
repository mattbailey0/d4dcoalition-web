Ever more attention is being turned to the increasing prevalence and potency of private information intelligence companies in the wake of a [report published earlier this year,][link] detailing the work of a for-profit American firm on behalf of the Qatari government. A recent New York Times report [revealed][link2] that as former state intelligence agents retire or defect from their agencies, private firms offer them employment on projects spying on behalf of corporations or smaller countries without the resources to operate a sophisticated spy network of their own. While these “internet mercenary” groups have been used to help stop Middle Eastern based terrorists, and violent drug traffickers in places like Mexico, they are also being used by autocratic regimes like Qatar to track rights-activists and journalists.
