A planned corporate advisory board on ethics in artificial intelligence has been [canceled by Google][link] after a wave of negative backlash over the past few months. The company had planned to include a few controversial figures on the board, which sparked outcry: transgender rights activists were upset about the inclusion of Heritage Foundation president Kay Cole James, while anti-war groups were upset about the inclusion of military drone company CEO Dyan Gibbens.
