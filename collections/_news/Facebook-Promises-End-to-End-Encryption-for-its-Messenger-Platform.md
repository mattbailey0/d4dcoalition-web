Seeking to improve his companyâ€™s beleaguered reputation, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg [released a blog post][link] in early March in which he [committed the company to the use of end-to-end encryption for its Messenger application.][link2] This may or may not assuage the fears of many online privacy advocates, who voiced grave concerns earlier this year when Facebook announced that it would merge the operating systems of Messenger with those of WhatsApp, a secure messaging service it has acquired. Critics fear that end-to-end encryption could be removed or modified during the merger, giving governments, nefarious actors, and Facebook itself greater access to track the messages of users.
