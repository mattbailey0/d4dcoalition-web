Facebook has [announced a new policy][link] for its users in Ukraine, wherein they must register to promote political ad content on the social media platform. To register, individuals must provide valid identification and enroll in two-factor identification system, while also agreeing to let all of their political content posted to Facebook contain a label that reads “paid for by (organization name here).” This move is likely a way to safeguard against disinformation in the lead-up to national elections this year.
