Youtube’s new fact checking algorithm, designed to provide viewers with factual information of videos that might have false or misleading information, [has caught a snag.][link] As videos of the recent burning of France’s Notre Dame cathedral surfaced on the streaming website, the algorithms began to display them with information from Encyclopedia Britannica about the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States.
