[A new report by Park Associates][link] conducted for the State Department details the history and current situation of misinformation in the world, as well as profiles five main state actors and their role in its spread. The report shows the danger that these states pose on internet platforms like Facebook and Google and how those companies might mitigate those challenges. Google [released a lengthy strategy][link2] that details how the company plans to counter disinformation on their platform, such as retooling its video recommendation algorithm on Youtube so that the site no longer steers viewers towards videos with questionable or false content.
