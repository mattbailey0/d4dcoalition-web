[A new Reuters research report][link] co-conducted with Oxford University shows that more Indians than ever (68% of those polled in the study) are receiving the bulk of their English-language online news from their mobile phones rather than computers or other devices. The report showed that social media sites like Facebook and WhatsApp were the biggest mediums for accessing news for Indians, rather than directly going to the news source’s website. This has in turn prompted [WhatsApp to roll out a new feature][link2] for its users in India ahead of this spring’s national elections. The feature, a tip line called Checkpoint, will allows users to submit messages, pictures or videos that they want checked, and Checkpoint employees will verify their accuracy.
