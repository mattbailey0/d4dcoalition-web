Facial recognition software grows in sophistication every year, but this isn’t accomplished without giving AI “practice”: Researchers often upload millions of pictures of human faces to the recognition software that they are developing so that their programs can further develop the algorithms needed to achieve greater face-sensing capacity. Often, the pictures the systems utilize are provided by corporations such as IBM, who take the photos from photography websites like Flickr. [When interviewed by NBC News,][link] some photographers were alarmed or disturbed that the photos they had taken of others might be used to electronically profile those individuals. These photographers complained that IBM had not sought their permission to use the photos, nor the permission of their artistic subjects.
