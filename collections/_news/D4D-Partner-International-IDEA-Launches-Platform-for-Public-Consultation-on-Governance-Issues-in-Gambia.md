International IDEA [launched a pilot][link] Public Participation Platform (PPP) to support national
constitution-making bodies that collect, store and analyze data from public consultations. The PPP is an online system tailorable to country-specific processes and accessible to country-level staff through individual login credentials. It features a survey function with an accompanying public URL to facilitate public engagement on constitutional issues, a storage facility to upload publicly submitted documents and recordings, and an analysis component wherein data can be exported to CSV files for SPSS analysis. The pilot system was developed in partnership with the Gambian Constitutional Review Commission (CRC), which plans to use the online survey feature to reach local and diaspora Gambians.
