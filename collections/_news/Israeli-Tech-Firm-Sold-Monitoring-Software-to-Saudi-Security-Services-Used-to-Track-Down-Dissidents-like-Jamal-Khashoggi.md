NSO Group, a little-known Israeli tech developer, created “Pegasus,” an incredibly sophisticated software program that can allow users to spy on the mobile phones of others, even when those phones are encrypted. While the technology has been credited with saving lives by foiling terrorist attack and shutting down drug and human trafficking rings, it has also been used by autocratic governments to track down and eliminate dissident citizens like Saudi Arabia's Jamal Khashoggi.
